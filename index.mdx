[**OpenAlex**](https://openalex.org) is a fully open catalog of the global research system. It's named after the [ancient Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria) and made by the nonprofit [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/).

This is the **technical documentation for OpenAlex**, including the [**OpenAlex API**](/api-reference/introduction) and the [**data snapshot**](/download/overview). Here, you can learn how to set up your code to access OpenAlex's data. If you want to explore the data as a human, you may be more interested in [**OpenAlex Web**](https://help.openalex.org).

## Data

The OpenAlex dataset describes scholarly [_entities_](/api-reference/introduction) and how those entities are connected to each other. Types of entities include [works](/api-reference/works), [authors](/api-reference/authors), [sources](/api-reference/sources), [institutions](/api-reference/institutions), [topics](/api-reference/topics), [publishers](/api-reference/publishers), and [funders](/api-reference/funders).

Together, these make a huge web (or more technically, heterogeneous directed [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)) of hundreds of millions of entities and billions of connections between them all.

## Access

We offer a fast, modern REST API to get OpenAlex data programmatically. It's free but requires an API key (also free). Get yours at [openalex.org/settings/api](https://openalex.org/settings/api). With your free key, you get 100,000 credits per day. [Learn more](/api-reference/introduction)

Different API operations consume different amounts of credits. See [rate limits and authentication](/guides/authentication) for details.

There is also a complete database snapshot available to download. [Learn more about the data snapshot here.](/download/overview)

The API has a limit of 100,000 credits per day, and the snapshot is updated monthly. If you need a higher limit, or more frequent updates, please look into a [**paid plan**](https://openalex.org/pricing).

The web interface for OpenAlex, built directly on top of the API, is the quickest and easiest way to [get started with OpenAlex](https://help.openalex.org/getting-started).

## Why OpenAlex?

OpenAlex offers an open replacement for industry-standard scientific knowledge bases like Elsevier's Scopus and Clarivate's Web of Science. [Compared to](https://openalex.org/about#comparison) these paywalled services, OpenAlex offers significant advantages in terms of inclusivity, affordability, and availability.

OpenAlex is:

- **Big** — We have about twice the coverage of the other services, and have significantly better coverage of non-English works and works from the Global South.
- **Easy** — Our service is fast, modern, and well-documented.
- **Open** — Our complete dataset is free under the CC0 license, which allows for transparency and reuse.

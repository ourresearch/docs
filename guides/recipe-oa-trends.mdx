title: Open Access Trends by Year
description: Track the growth of open access publishing over the last decade
---

How has open access publishing changed over the last decade? Two API calls and some simple subtraction give you a year-by-year breakdown.

## Step 1: Get total works by year

Use `group_by=publication_year` to count all works per year:

```bash
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=publication_year:2015-2025&group_by=publication_year
```

The response `group_by` array contains one entry per year:

```json
[
  {"key": "2015", "key_display_name": "2015", "count": 9949715},
  {"key": "2016", "key_display_name": "2016", "count": 10262596},
  {"key": "2017", "key_display_name": "2017", "count": 10109865}
]
```

## Step 2: Get open access works by year

Add `open_access.is_oa:true` to the filter to count only OA works:

```bash
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=publication_year:2015-2025,open_access.is_oa:true&group_by=publication_year
```

Same shape, smaller counts:

```json
[
  {"key": "2015", "key_display_name": "2015", "count": 3066358},
  {"key": "2016", "key_display_name": "2016", "count": 3383207},
  {"key": "2017", "key_display_name": "2017", "count": 3564129}
]
```

## Step 3: Combine the results

Match up the two responses by year and compute the OA percentage.

```python
import requests

total_resp = requests.get(
    "https://api.openalex.org/works",
    params={"filter": "publication_year:2015-2025", "group_by": "publication_year"}
).json()

oa_resp = requests.get(
    "https://api.openalex.org/works",
    params={"filter": "publication_year:2015-2025,open_access.is_oa:true", "group_by": "publication_year"}
).json()

total_by_year = {g["key"]: g["count"] for g in total_resp["group_by"]}
oa_by_year = {g["key"]: g["count"] for g in oa_resp["group_by"]}

for year in sorted(total_by_year):
    total = total_by_year[year]
    oa = oa_by_year.get(year, 0)
    pct = 100 * oa / total
    print(f"{year}: {total:>12,} total | {oa:>12,} OA | {pct:.1f}%")
```

## Results

Data retrieved February 2026. Counts are approximate and will shift as OpenAlex continues indexing.

| Year | Total | Open Access | Closed | OA % |
|------|------:|------------:|-------:|-----:|
| 2015 | 9,949,715 | 3,066,358 | 6,883,357 | 30.8% |
| 2016 | 10,262,596 | 3,383,207 | 6,879,389 | 33.0% |
| 2017 | 10,109,865 | 3,564,129 | 6,545,736 | 35.3% |
| 2018 | 10,108,715 | 4,005,694 | 6,103,021 | 39.6% |
| 2019 | 10,450,545 | 4,443,271 | 6,007,274 | 42.5% |
| 2020 | 11,170,634 | 5,401,409 | 5,769,225 | 48.4% |
| 2021 | 10,245,183 | 5,550,323 | 4,694,860 | 54.2% |
| 2022 | 9,848,360 | 6,024,699 | 3,823,661 | 61.2% |
| 2023 | 10,424,813 | 6,457,754 | 3,967,059 | 62.0% |
| 2024 | 10,221,658 | 6,213,783 | 4,007,875 | 60.8% |
| 2025 | 13,991,991 | 9,510,756 | 4,481,235 | 67.9% |

Open access has grown from roughly 31% to 68% of indexed works over the last decade. The crossover point — where OA works first outnumbered closed — was around 2021.

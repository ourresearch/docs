description: Understanding scholarly works in OpenAlex
---

Works are scholarly documents: journal articles, books, datasets, theses, and more. OpenAlex indexes hundreds of millions of works, with tens of thousands added daily.

```bash
# List all works
https://api.openalex.org/works

# Get a specific work
https://api.openalex.org/works/W2741809807
```

## Sources

OpenAlex collects works from:
- **Crossref** — DOI registrations from publishers
- **PubMed** — Biomedical literature
- **Repositories** — arXiv, institutional repositories, discipline-specific archives
- **Microsoft Academic Graph** — Historical data (now defunct)

## Citation metrics

### FWCI (Field-Weighted Citation Impact)

FWCI measures a work's citation impact relative to the world average for its publication type, subfield, and year. It's calculated as:

```
FWCI = citations received / citations expected
```

The "expected" value is based on citations in the year of publication and the three following years. An FWCI of 1.0 means world average; 2.0 means twice the expected citations.

<Note>
OpenAlex's database is more comprehensive than many others and includes many works without citations. This drives down average expected citation values, so works that do get cited tend to have higher FWCI in OpenAlex compared to other services.
</Note>

Not all work types receive many citations (e.g., paratext). When they do, their FWCI can be extreme outliers. OpenAlex excludes these types from FWCI calculations to avoid distorting averages.

Related fields on the [Work object](/api-reference/works):
- `fwci` — The raw FWCI value
- `citation_normalized_percentile` — The same information expressed as a percentile (with `is_in_top_1_percent` and `is_in_top_10_percent` flags)

### Citation links

Works link to other works through:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `referenced_works` | Outgoing citations (works this one cites) |
| `cited_by_api_url` | Incoming citations (works that cite this one) |
| `related_works` | Semantically related works |

```bash
# Get works that cite a specific work
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2741809807
```

## Common filters

| Filter | Example |
|--------|---------|
| By year | `filter=publication_year:2023` |
| By type | `filter=type:article` |
| By OA status | `filter=open_access.is_oa:true` |
| By author | `filter=author.id:A5023888391` |
| By institution | `filter=institutions.id:I27837315` |
| By topic | `filter=topics.id:T10560` |
| Has abstract | `filter=has_abstract:true` |
| Has DOI | `filter=has_doi:true` |
| High citations | `filter=cited_by_count:>100` |

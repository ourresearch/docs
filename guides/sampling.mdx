title: Sampling
description: Get random samples of entities
---

Use `sample` to get a random list of up to 10,000 results:

```bash
# 100 random works
https://api.openalex.org/works?sample=100&per_page=100

# 50 random open access works from 2021
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=open_access.is_oa:true,publication_year:2021&sample=50&per_page=50
```

## Reproducible samples

Add a `seed` value to get the same random results on repeated requests:

```bash
# Same 20 sources each time
https://api.openalex.org/sources?sample=20&seed=123
```

<Note>
Random results with a seed may change over time as new records enter OpenAlex.
</Note>

## Limitations

| Constraint | Limit |
|------------|-------|
| Maximum sample size | 10,000 |
| Paging | Basic paging only (cursor not supported) |
| Seed requirement | Required when paging beyond page 1 |

<Warning>
Without a `seed` value when paging, you may get duplicate records across pages.
</Warning>

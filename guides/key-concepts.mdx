# Key Concepts

Before diving into the API, it helps to understand a few core concepts that underpin everything in OpenAlex.

## Entity Types

OpenAlex describes scholarly research as a graph of interconnected **entities**. There are eight entity types:

<Note>
Counts are approximate and change as new data is added. Use `/works?per_page=1` (etc.) for current counts.
</Note>

| Entity | Description | Approx. Count |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| [Works](/guides/works) | Scholarly documents (articles, books, datasets, theses) | hundreds of millions |
| [Authors](/guides/authors) | Researchers who create works | tens of millions |
| [Sources](/guides/sources) | Where works are hosted (journals, repositories, conferences) | 250K+ |
| [Institutions](/guides/institutions) | Organizations where authors are affiliated | 110K+ |
| [Topics](/guides/topics-and-keywords) | Subject classifications (3-level hierarchy) | 4.5K |
| [Publishers](/guides/publishers) | Organizations that distribute works | 10K+ |
| [Funders](/guides/funders-and-awards) | Organizations that fund research | 35K+ |
| [Geo](/guides/geo) | Geographic information (countries, continents) | — |

Each entity type has its own API endpoint (e.g., `/works`, `/authors`).

## OpenAlex IDs

Every entity in OpenAlex has a unique **OpenAlex ID**. It's a URL formatted like this:

```
https://openalex.org/W2741809807
```

### ID Structure

The ID has two parts:

1. **Base**: Always `https://openalex.org/`
2. **Key**: A letter prefix + numeric ID (e.g., `W2741809807`)

The letter prefix indicates the entity type:

| Prefix | Entity |
|--------|--------|
| W | Work |
| A | Author |
| S | Source |
| I | Institution |
| T | Topic |
| K | Keyword |
| P | Publisher |
| F | Funder |
| G | Award (Grant) |
| C | Concept (deprecated) |

IDs are case-insensitive: `W2741809807` and `w2741809807` are equivalent.

### Using IDs in the API

You can use just the key portion when making API calls:

```bash
# Full URL
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works/https://openalex.org/W2741809807"

# Just the key (recommended)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works/W2741809807"
```

### External IDs

You can also retrieve entities using external IDs like DOIs, ORCIDs, and RORs:

```bash
# By DOI
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works/https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375"

# By ORCID
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors/https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1613-5981"

# By ROR
curl "https://api.openalex.org/institutions/https://ror.org/02y3ad647"

# Shorthand format
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works/doi:10.7717/peerj.4375"
```

### Canonical External IDs

Each entity type has a "canonical" external ID—the most widely adopted identifier for that type:

| Entity | Canonical ID |
|--------|--------------|
| Works | DOI |
| Authors | ORCID |
| Sources | ISSN-L |
| Institutions | ROR |
| Topics | Wikidata ID |
| Publishers | Wikidata ID |

### Merged IDs

Sometimes we merge duplicate entities (e.g., two author records for the same person). If you request a merged ID, you'll be redirected to the new ID:

```bash
$ curl -i https://api.openalex.org/authors/A5092938886
HTTP/1.1 301 MOVED PERMANENTLY
Location: https://api.openalex.org/authors/A5006060960
```

Most HTTP clients handle this automatically.

## Dehydrated Objects

When entities are nested inside other entities, they're often returned in **dehydrated** form—a stripped-down version with only essential fields.

For example, a Work's `authorships` field contains dehydrated Author objects:

```json
{
  "authorships": [
    {
      "author": {
        "id": "https://openalex.org/A5023888391",
        "display_name": "Jason Priem",
        "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6187-6610"
      },
      "institutions": [
        {
          "id": "https://openalex.org/I4200000001",
          "display_name": "OurResearch",
          "ror": "https://ror.org/02nr0ka47",
          "country_code": "US",
          "type": "nonprofit"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To get the full entity, make a separate request using the ID:

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors/A5023888391"
```

## XPAC (Expansion Pack)

In November 2025, OpenAlex added 190+ million new works as part of an expansion called **XPAC** (part of the [Walden rewrite](https://blog.openalex.org/openalex-rewrite-walden-launch/)). This includes:

- All of DataCite
- Thousands of institutional and subject-area repositories
- Primarily datasets and repository records

### Why XPAC Works Are Excluded by Default

XPAC works have lower data quality on average (improving over time). To avoid surprising users with sudden changes in result counts and quality, **XPAC works are excluded by default**.

### Including XPAC Works

Add `include_xpac=true` to any works endpoint:

```bash
# Without XPAC (default)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works"

# With XPAC (roughly doubles the count)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?include_xpac=true"
```

### Filtering by XPAC

Each work has an `is_xpac` boolean field:

```bash
# Get only XPAC works
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?include_xpac=true&filter=is_xpac:true"
```

## Query Parameter Naming

<Note>
OpenAlex uses **snake_case** for all query parameters: `filter`, `sort`, `group_by`, `per_page`, `api_key`, etc.

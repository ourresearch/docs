Before diving into the API, it helps to understand a few core concepts that underpin everything in OpenAlex.

## Entity Types

OpenAlex describes scholarly research as a graph of interconnected **entities**. There are eight entity types:

<Note>
Counts are approximate and change as new data is added. Use `/works?per_page=1` (etc.) for current counts.
</Note>

| Entity | Description | Approx. Count |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| [Works](/api-reference/works) | Scholarly documents (articles, books, datasets, theses) | hundreds of millions |
| [Authors](/api-reference/authors) | Researchers who create works | tens of millions |
| [Sources](/api-reference/sources) | Where works are hosted (journals, repositories, conferences) | 250K+ |
| [Institutions](/api-reference/institutions) | Organizations where authors are affiliated | 110K+ |
| [Topics](/api-reference/topics) | Subject classifications (4-level hierarchy) | 4.5K |
| [Publishers](/api-reference/publishers) | Organizations that distribute works | 10K+ |
| [Funders](/api-reference/funders) | Organizations that fund research | 35K+ |
| [Countries](/api-reference/countries) | Geographic information (countries, continents) | — |

Each entity type has its own API endpoint (e.g., `/works`, `/authors`).

## Topic Hierarchy

Topics are organized in a four-level hierarchy:

| Level | Name | Count | Example |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | [Domain](/api-reference/domains) | 4 | Physical Sciences |
| 2 | [Field](/api-reference/fields) | 26 | Computer Science |
| 3 | [Subfield](/api-reference/subfields) | 254 | Artificial Intelligence |
| 4 | [Topic](/api-reference/topics) | ~4,500 | Natural Language Processing |

Every work is assigned a `primary_topic` which includes the full hierarchy path. You can filter by any level: `filter=primary_topic.domain.id:1`, `filter=primary_topic.field.id:17`, etc.

## OpenAlex IDs

Every entity in OpenAlex has a unique **OpenAlex ID**. It's a URL formatted like this:

```
https://openalex.org/W2741809807
```

### ID Structure

The ID has two parts:

1. **Base**: Always `https://openalex.org/`
2. **Key**: A letter prefix + numeric ID (e.g., `W2741809807`)

The letter prefix indicates the entity type:

| Prefix | Entity |
|--------|--------|
| W | Work |
| A | Author |
| S | Source |
| I | Institution |
| T | Topic |
| K | Keyword |
| P | Publisher |
| F | Funder |
| G | Award (Grant) |
| C | Concept (deprecated) |

IDs are case-insensitive: `W2741809807` and `w2741809807` are equivalent.

### Using IDs in the API

You can use just the key portion when making API calls:

```bash
# Full URL
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works/https://openalex.org/W2741809807"

# Just the key (recommended)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works/W2741809807"
```

### Resolve IDs

<Warning>
**Don't filter by names directly.** Entity names are ambiguous—"MIT" could match multiple institutions, "Smith" matches thousands of authors. Always resolve names to IDs first.
</Warning>

When you want to find works by a specific author, institution, journal, or topic, use the **two-step pattern**:

1. **Search** for the entity to get its OpenAlex ID
2. **Filter** works using that ID

This avoids hallucinated filters and ensures you get the right entity.

#### The Two-Step Pattern

**Step 1: Search for the Entity**

Use the search endpoint for the entity type:

```bash
# Find an author
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors?search=Albert+Einstein"

# Find an institution
curl "https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=MIT"

# Find a journal
curl "https://api.openalex.org/sources?search=Nature"

# Find a topic
curl "https://api.openalex.org/topics?search=machine+learning"
```

The response includes IDs you can use:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "https://openalex.org/A5012345678",
      "display_name": "Albert Einstein",
      "works_count": 272
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2: Filter Works by ID**

Use the ID to filter works:

```bash
# Works by this author
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.author.id:A5012345678"

# Works from this institution
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:I136199984"

# Works in this journal
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=primary_location.source.id:S137773608"

# Works on this topic
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=topics.id:T12345"
```

#### Common Lookups

**Find Works by Author Name**

```bash
# Step 1: Search for the author
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors?search=Heather+Piwowar"
# Response: id = "https://openalex.org/A5023888391"

# Step 2: Get their works
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.author.id:A5023888391"
```

**Find Works by Institution Name**

```bash
# Step 1: Search for the institution
curl "https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=Stanford+University"
# Response: id = "https://openalex.org/I97018004"

# Step 2: Get works from that institution
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:I97018004"
```

**Find Works by Journal Name**

```bash
# Step 1: Search for the journal (source)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/sources?search=Nature"
# Response: id = "https://openalex.org/S137773608"

# Step 2: Get works published there
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=primary_location.source.id:S137773608"
```

**Find Works by Topic**

```bash
# Step 1: Search for the topic
curl "https://api.openalex.org/topics?search=CRISPR"
# Response: id = "https://openalex.org/T10234"

# Step 2: Get works on that topic
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=topics.id:T10234"
```

#### When You Have External IDs

If you already have an external identifier (DOI, ORCID, ROR, ISSN), you can skip the search step and use the ID directly:

```bash
# By ORCID (author)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.author.id:https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1613-5981"

# By ROR (institution)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:https://ror.org/042nb2s44"

# By ISSN (source/journal)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/sources/issn:0028-0836"
# Then use the returned OpenAlex ID
```

#### Decision Guide

| Input Type | What to Do |
|------------|------------|
| Name (ambiguous) | Search first, then filter by ID |
| ORCID | Use directly: `authorships.author.id:https://orcid.org/...` |
| ROR | Use directly: `authorships.institutions.id:https://ror.org/...` |
| DOI | Get work directly: `/works/https://doi.org/...` |
| ISSN | Get source by ISSN, then filter by source ID |
| OpenAlex ID | Use directly: `authorships.author.id:A123456` |

#### Handling Ambiguous Results

When searching returns multiple matches, you need to pick the right one:

**Use Additional Filters**

Narrow down the search:

```bash
# Author named "Smith" affiliated with MIT
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors?search=Smith&filter=last_known_institution.id:I63966007"
```

**Check Display Name and Metadata**

Look at `display_name`, `works_count`, `cited_by_count`, and institutional affiliations to identify the right entity.

**Use Autocomplete for Interactive UIs**

The autocomplete endpoint is fast and returns ranked results:

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/autocomplete/authors?q=einst"
```

#### Filter Field Reference

| To find works by... | Filter field |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Author | `authorships.author.id` |
| Author's institution | `authorships.institutions.id` |
| Primary source (journal) | `primary_location.source.id` |
| Any source | `locations.source.id` |
| Topic | `topics.id` or `primary_topic.id` |
| Publisher | `primary_location.source.host_organization` |
| Funder | `funders.id` |

#### Example: Complete Workflow

Find highly-cited papers about machine learning from MIT in the last 3 years:

```bash
# 1. Get MIT's ID
curl "https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=MIT"
# Result: I63966007

# 2. Get machine learning topic ID
curl "https://api.openalex.org/topics?search=machine+learning"
# Result: T154945302

# 3. Filter works with all criteria
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:I63966007,topics.id:T154945302,publication_year:>2022&sort=cited_by_count:desc"
```

### External IDs

You can also retrieve entities using external IDs like DOIs, ORCIDs, and RORs:

```bash
# By DOI
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works/https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375"

# By ORCID
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors/https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1613-5981"

# By ROR
curl "https://api.openalex.org/institutions/https://ror.org/02y3ad647"

# Shorthand format
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works/doi:10.7717/peerj.4375"
```

### Canonical External IDs

Each entity type has a "canonical" external ID—the most widely adopted identifier for that type:

| Entity | Canonical ID |
|--------|--------------|
| Works | DOI |
| Authors | ORCID |
| Sources | ISSN-L |
| Institutions | ROR |
| Topics | Wikidata ID |
| Publishers | Wikidata ID |

### Merged IDs

Sometimes we merge duplicate entities (e.g., two author records for the same person). If you request a merged ID, you'll be redirected to the new ID:

```bash
$ curl -i https://api.openalex.org/authors/A5092938886
HTTP/1.1 301 MOVED PERMANENTLY
Location: https://api.openalex.org/authors/A5006060960
```

Most HTTP clients handle this automatically.

## Dehydrated Objects

When entities are nested inside other entities, they're often returned in **dehydrated** form—a stripped-down version with only essential fields.

For example, a Work's `authorships` field contains dehydrated Author objects:

```json
{
  "authorships": [
    {
      "author": {
        "id": "https://openalex.org/A5023888391",
        "display_name": "Jason Priem",
        "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6187-6610"
      },
      "institutions": [
        {
          "id": "https://openalex.org/I4200000001",
          "display_name": "OurResearch",
          "ror": "https://ror.org/02nr0ka47",
          "country_code": "US",
          "type": "nonprofit"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To get the full entity, make a separate request using the ID:

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors/A5023888391"
```

## XPAC (Expansion Pack)

In November 2025, OpenAlex added 190+ million new works as part of an expansion called **XPAC** (part of the [Walden rewrite](https://blog.openalex.org/openalex-rewrite-walden-launch/)). This includes:

- All of DataCite
- Thousands of institutional and subject-area repositories
- Primarily datasets and repository records

### Why XPAC Works Are Excluded by Default

XPAC works have lower data quality on average (improving over time). To avoid surprising users with sudden changes in result counts and quality, **XPAC works are excluded by default**.

### Including XPAC Works

Add `include_xpac=true` to any works endpoint:

```bash
# Without XPAC (default)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works"

# With XPAC (roughly doubles the count)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?include_xpac=true"
```

### Filtering by XPAC

Each work has an `is_xpac` boolean field:

```bash
# Get only XPAC works
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?include_xpac=true&filter=is_xpac:true"
```

## Query Parameter Naming

<Note>
OpenAlex uses **snake_case** for all query parameters: `filter`, `sort`, `group_by`, `per_page`, `api_key`, etc.

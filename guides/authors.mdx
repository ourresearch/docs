description: Understanding author entities in OpenAlex
---

Authors are people who create scholarly works. OpenAlex indexes over 90 million authors.

```bash
# List all authors
https://api.openalex.org/authors

# Get a specific author
https://api.openalex.org/authors/A5023888391
```

## Author disambiguation

OpenAlex uses machine learning to automatically cluster works by the same person, even when names vary. The system considers:

- Name similarity
- Co-author patterns
- Institutional affiliations
- Research topics
- Citation patterns

This means "J. Smith" and "John Smith" at the same institution working on similar topics are likely merged into one author record.

<Note>
Disambiguation isn't perfect. Some authors may be incorrectly split or merged. If you notice issues, contact support@openalex.org.

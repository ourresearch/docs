description: API keys, credit costs, and rate limiting

The OpenAlex API uses a credit-based rate limiting system. Different endpoint types consume different amounts of credits per request.

<Warning>
**API key required starting February 13, 2026.** API keys are free—[get yours here](https://openalex.org/settings/api). See the [announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/rI1GIAySpVQ) for details.
</Warning>

## Getting an API Key

API keys are free. Here's how to get one:

1. Create a free account at [openalex.org](https://openalex.org)
2. Go to [openalex.org/settings/api](https://openalex.org/settings/api) to get your key
3. Add `api_key=YOUR_KEY` to your API calls

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
```

Without an API key, you're limited to 100 credits per day—enough for quick tests, but not for real work.

## What you can do for free every day

With a free API key (10,000 credits/day), you can make per day:
- **Unlimited** singleton requests (they're free)
- **10,000** list/filter requests, or
- **1,000** search requests, or
- **100** content downloads, or
- Any combination that adds up to 10,000 credits

All plans can purchase additional credits at **$1 per 10,000 credits**.

For full details on credit costs, rate limit headers, query limits, and usage tips, see [Authentication & Rate Limits](/api-reference/authentication) in the API Reference.

The OpenAlex API uses usage-based pricing on a freemium model. Different types of usage have different costs per request. A free API key is required.

## Getting an API Key

API keys are free. Here's how to get one:

1. Create a free account at [openalex.org](https://openalex.org)
2. Go to [openalex.org/settings/api](https://openalex.org/settings/api) to get your key
3. Add `api_key=YOUR_KEY` to your API calls

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
```

Without an API key, you're limited to $0.01/day of usage—enough for quick tests, but not for real work.

## What You Can Do for Free Every Day

With a free API key ($1/day allowance), you can make per day:
- **Unlimited** singleton requests (they're free)
- **10,000** list+filter requests (1M results at 100/page)
- **1,000** search requests (100K results at 100/page)
- **100** content downloads
- Any mix totaling $1

Use `per_page=100` to load many results per query--it makes your query budget go much further.

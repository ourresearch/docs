description: "Get lists of entities with filtering, searching, and sorting"
---

To get a list of entities, make a GET request to the entity endpoint:

```
GET https://api.openalex.org/<entity_type>
```

For example, to get a list of works:

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works"
```

This returns a response with metadata and a list of results:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "count": 268459381,
    "db_response_time_ms": 81,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 25
  },
  "results": [
    // list of Work objects
  ],
  "group_by": []
}
```

## Response structure

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `meta.count` | Total number of entities matching your query |
| `meta.page` | Current page number |
| `meta.per_page` | Number of results per page (default: 25, max: 200) |
| `results` | Array of entity objects |
| `group_by` | Aggregation results (empty unless you use `group_by`) |

## Query parameters

List queries become powerful when you add parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `filter` | Narrow results by attributes | `filter=type:article` |
| `search` | Full-text search | `search=machine learning` |
| `sort` | Order results | `sort=cited_by_count:desc` |
| `page` | Pagination | `page=2` |
| `per_page` | Results per page | `per_page=100` |
| `select` | Choose which fields to return | `select=id,title` |
| `group_by` | Aggregate by a field | `group_by=publication_year` |

### Example: Recent high-impact articles about climate

```
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=type:article,publication_year:2024,cited_by_count:>100&search=climate change&sort=cited_by_count:desc&per_page=50
```

## Entity endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/works` | Scholarly documents (papers, books, datasets) |
| `/authors` | People who create works |
| `/sources` | Where works are published (journals, repositories) |
| `/institutions` | Universities and research organizations |
| `/topics` | Research topics and fields |
| `/publishers` | Publishing organizations |
| `/funders` | Organizations that fund research |
| `/awards` | Specific grants and awards |

## Grouping results

Use `group_by` to aggregate results by a field:

```
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:I27837315&group_by=publication_year
```

This returns counts of works by year for a given institution:

```json
{
  "group_by": [
    { "key": "2024", "count": 12543 },
    { "key": "2023", "count": 45231 },
    { "key": "2022", "count": 43892 }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
Grouping is useful for building charts and understanding distributions in your data.

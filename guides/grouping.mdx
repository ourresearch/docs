description: Aggregate entities into faceted counts using group_by
---

The `group_by` parameter aggregates entities into groups and counts how many are in each group.

```bash
# Count works by type
https://api.openalex.org/works?group_by=type
```

Response:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "count": 246136992,
    "groups_count": 15
  },
  "group_by": [
    {
      "key": "article",
      "key_display_name": "article",
      "count": 202814957
    },
    {
      "key": "book-chapter",
      "key_display_name": "book-chapter",
      "count": 21250659
    },
    {
      "key": "dissertation",
      "key_display_name": "dissertation",
      "count": 6055973
    }
  ]
}
```

## Group properties

Each group object contains:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `key` | The OpenAlex ID or raw value for this group |
| `key_display_name` | The display name or raw value for this group |
| `count` | Number of entities in the group |

### `key` vs `key_display_name`

When grouping by an OpenAlex entity, `key` is the ID and `key_display_name` is the display name:

```bash
# Group works by institution
https://api.openalex.org/works?group_by=authorships.institutions.id
```

Returns groups like:
```json
{
  "key": "https://openalex.org/I136199984",
  "key_display_name": "Harvard University",
  "count": 1234567
}
```

For non-entity values (like `level`), both `key` and `key_display_name` are the raw value.

## Including unknowns

The "unknown" group (entities without a value) is hidden by default. Add `:include_unknown` to include it:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Without unknowns (default)
https://api.openalex.org/works?group_by=authorships.countries
```

```bash With unknowns
https://api.openalex.org/works?group_by=authorships.countries:include_unknown
```
</CodeGroup>

## Combining with filters

Group by and filter work together:

```bash
# Count work types for 2023 publications
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=publication_year:2023&group_by=type

# Count open access status for a specific author
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=author.id:A5023888391&group_by=open_access.is_oa
```

## Paging

Maximum 200 groups per page. Use [cursor paging](/guides/page-through-results#cursor-paging) for more.

<Note>
When paging through groups, results are sorted by `key` (not by `count`).
</Note>

## Meta properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `meta.count` | Total entities matching the filter |
| `meta.groups_count` | Number of groups in current page (or `null` if none) |

<Note>
Due to technical limitations, `groups_count` only reports groups in the current page, not the total number of groups.
</Note>

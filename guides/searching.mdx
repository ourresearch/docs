The `search` parameter finds results matching a given text search. Search requests cost **10 credits** each (vs. 1 credit for list/filter requests). See [credit costs](/guides/authentication#credit-costs-by-endpoint).

```bash
# Works with "dna" in title, abstract, or fulltext
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=dna
```

## What gets searched

Each entity type searches different fields:

| Entity | Searchable fields |
|--------|-------------------|
| Works | `title`, `abstract`, `fulltext` |
| Authors | `display_name`, `display_name_alternatives` |
| Sources | `display_name`, `alternate_titles`, `abbreviated_title` |
| Institutions | `display_name`, `display_name_alternatives`, `display_name_acronyms` |
| Topics/Keywords | `display_name`, `description` |

## Search filter

Use `.search` as a filter suffix to search specific fields. These also cost 10 credits per request.

```bash
# Authors with "Einstein" in their name
https://api.openalex.org/authors?filter=display_name.search:einstein

# Works with "cubist" in the title only
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=title.search:cubist
```

The `default.search` filter works the same as the `search` parameter.

<Warning>
**Don't use search filters for autocomplete.** The [autocomplete endpoint](/guides/autocomplete) is much faster:

```bash
# Slow
https://api.openalex.org/institutions?filter=display_name.search:florida

# Fast
https://api.openalex.org/autocomplete/institutions?q=Florida
```
</Warning>

## Text processing

OpenAlex uses [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and removes [stop words](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stop-tokenfilter.html) to improve results:

- Words like "the" and "an" are removed
- A search for "possums" also returns "possum"
- Searches match whole words only ("lun" won't match "lunar")

### Exact (unstemmed) search

Use `search.exact` to search without stemming. This works as a top-level parameter or as a filter suffix:

```bash
# Top-level unstemmed search
https://api.openalex.org/works?search.exact=surgery

# As a filter on specific fields
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=display_name.search.exact:surgery
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=title.search.exact:surgery
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=abstract.search.exact:surgery
```

<Note>
Only one search parameter is allowed per request: `search`, `search.exact`, or `search.semantic`.
</Note>

## Boolean search

Use `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` (uppercase) for complex queries. Surround phrases with double quotes for exact matching:

```bash
# Works about "elmo" AND "sesame street" but NOT "cookie" or "monster"
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=(elmo AND "sesame street") NOT (cookie OR monster)
```

<Note>
Words not separated by boolean operators are treated as `AND`.
</Note>

## Phrase and proximity search

### Phrase matching

Use double quotes to search for an exact phrase. Multi-word searches without quotes rank results higher when words appear close together.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Exact phrase (few results)
https://api.openalex.org/works?search="fierce creatures"
```

```bash Words anywhere (more results)
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=fierce creatures
```
</CodeGroup>

### Proximity search

Append `~N` to a quoted phrase to find the words within N positions of each other, without requiring an exact match:

```bash
# "climate" and "change" within 5 words of each other
https://api.openalex.org/works?search="climate change"~5

# Also works as a filter
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=title.search:"climate change"~5
```

## Wildcards and fuzzy search

### Wildcards

Use `*` to match zero or more characters and `?` to match exactly one character:

- **Trailing wildcard:** `machin*` matches "machine", "machines", "machinery"
- **Single-character wildcard:** `wom?n` matches "woman" and "women"

The search term must have at least 3 characters before the wildcard. Leading wildcards (e.g., `*ology`) are not supported.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Top-level search
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=machin*
```

```bash Filter search
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=display_name.search:machin*
```
</CodeGroup>

### Fuzzy search

Append `~N` to a term to allow up to N character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions). The edit distance N can be 0, 1, or 2:

```bash
# Matches "machine", "machin", and other close variants
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=machin~1
```

The search term must have at least 3 characters before the `~`. This is useful for catching typos and spelling variations.

## Relevance score

Search results include a `relevance_score` property and are sorted by it (descending) by default. The score is based on:

- Text similarity to your search term
- Citation count (more cited = higher score)

## Keyword vs. semantic search

| Use keyword search when... | Use [semantic search](/guides/similar-works) when... |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| You know the exact terms | You want conceptually related works |
| You need filters/sorting | You're exploring a new research area |
| You want specific fields | Your query is a sentence or paragraph |

Semantic search uses AI embeddings to find works by meaning. A query about "machine learning in healthcare" finds papers using "AI-driven diagnosis" or "computational medicine."

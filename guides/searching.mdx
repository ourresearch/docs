---

The `search` parameter finds results matching a given text search.

```bash
# Works with "dna" in title, abstract, or fulltext
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=dna
```

## What gets searched

Each entity type searches different fields:

| Entity | Searchable fields |
|--------|-------------------|
| Works | `title`, `abstract`, `fulltext` |
| Authors | `display_name`, `display_name_alternatives` |
| Sources | `display_name`, `alternate_titles`, `abbreviated_title` |
| Institutions | `display_name`, `display_name_alternatives`, `display_name_acronyms` |
| Topics/Keywords | `display_name`, `description` |

## Text processing

OpenAlex uses [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and removes [stop words](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stop-tokenfilter.html) to improve results:

- Words like "the" and "an" are removed
- A search for "possums" also returns "possum"
- Searches match whole words only ("lun" won't match "lunar")

### Disable stemming

Add `.no_stem` to search without stemming:

```bash
# Exact match "surgery" without "surgeries"
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=display_name.search.no_stem:surgery
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=title.search.no_stem:surgery
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=abstract.search.no_stem:surgery
```

## Boolean searches

Use `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` (uppercase) for complex queries. Surround phrases with double quotes for exact matching:

```bash
# Works about "elmo" AND "sesame street" but NOT "cookie" or "monster"
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=(elmo AND "sesame street") NOT (cookie OR monster)
```

<Note>
Words not separated by boolean operators are treated as `AND`. Wildcard (`*`, `?`) and fuzzy (`~`) searches are not supported.
</Note>

## Relevance score

Search results include a `relevance_score` property and are sorted by it (descending) by default. The score is based on:

- Text similarity to your search term
- Citation count (more cited = higher score)

### Phrase matching

Multi-word searches rank results higher when words appear close together. For exact phrase matching, use quotes:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Exact phrase (few results)
https://api.openalex.org/works?search="fierce creatures"
```

```bash Words anywhere (more results)
https://api.openalex.org/works?search=fierce creatures
```
</CodeGroup>

## Search filter

Use `.search` as a filter suffix to search specific fields:

```bash
# Authors with "Einstein" in their name
https://api.openalex.org/authors?filter=display_name.search:einstein

# Works with "cubist" in the title only
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=title.search:cubist
```

The `default.search` filter works the same as the `search` parameter.

<Warning>
**Don't use search filters for autocomplete.** The [autocomplete endpoint](/guides/autocomplete) is much faster:

```bash
# Slow
https://api.openalex.org/institutions?filter=display_name.search:florida

# Fast
https://api.openalex.org/autocomplete/institutions?q=Florida
```
</Warning>

## Keyword vs. semantic search

| Use keyword search when... | Use [semantic search](/guides/similar-works) when... |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| You know the exact terms | You want conceptually related works |
| You need filters/sorting | You're exploring a new research area |
| You want specific fields | Your query is a sentence or paragraph |

Semantic search uses AI embeddings to find works by meaning. A query about "machine learning in healthcare" finds papers using "AI-driven diagnosis" or "computational medicine."

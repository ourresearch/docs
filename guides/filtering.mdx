description: Narrow down results to entities that match specific conditions
---

Filters narrow your results to entities matching specific conditions. Use the `filter` parameter with attribute-value pairs:

```
filter=attribute:value,attribute2:value2
```

<Note>
Filters are case-insensitive.
</Note>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash Works by type
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=type:book"
```

```bash Authors by ORCID status
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors?filter=has_orcid:true,works_count:>100"
```

```bash Sources with many works
curl "https://api.openalex.org/sources?filter=works_count:>1000"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Logical expressions

### Inequality

For numerical filters, use `<` and `>` for inequalities:

```bash
# Sources hosting more than 1000 works
https://api.openalex.org/sources?filter=works_count:>1000
```

Some attributes have convenience filters like `from_publication_date` and `to_publication_date`:

```bash
# Works published between Jan 1-26, 2022
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=from_publication_date:2022-01-01,to_publication_date:2022-01-26
```

### Negation (NOT)

Prepend `!` to negate any filter:

```bash
# All institutions except those in the US
https://api.openalex.org/institutions?filter=country_code:!us
```

### Intersection (AND)

Comma-separated filters are combined with AND:

```bash
# Works cited more than once AND open access
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cited_by_count:>1,is_oa:true
```

For AND within a single attribute, repeat the filter or use `+`:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Repeating filters
# Works with authors from France AND UK
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=institutions.country_code:fr,institutions.country_code:gb
```

```bash Using + symbol
# Works with authors from France AND UK
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=institutions.country_code:fr+gb
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The `+` syntax doesn't work for search filters, boolean filters, or numeric filters.
</Note>

### Addition (OR)

Use the pipe `|` to match any of multiple values:

```bash
# Works with authors from France OR UK
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=institutions.country_code:fr|gb
```

This is efficient for retrieving many records by ID at once:

```bash
# Get two works by DOI in one request
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=doi:https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266781|https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267149
```

<Warning>
**OR limit:** You can combine up to 100 values with `|` in a single filter. Use `per_page=100` to get all results.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**OR works within a filter, not between filters.** This will return an error:
```bash
# INVALID: OR between different filters
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=institutions.country_code:fr|primary_location.source.issn:0957-1558
```
</Warning>

## Available filters by entity

Each entity type has its own set of filterable fields. See the API reference for complete filter lists:

| Entity | Filters |
|--------|---------|
| [Works](/api-reference/works) | `publication_year`, `type`, `open_access.is_oa`, `author.id`, `institutions.id`, `cited_by_count`, `doi`, `has_abstract`, and ~150 more |
| [Authors](/api-reference/authors) | `has_orcid`, `last_known_institutions.id`, `works_count`, `cited_by_count`, `orcid` |
| [Sources](/api-reference/sources) | `is_oa`, `is_in_doaj`, `type`, `country_code`, `host_organization`, `issn` |
| [Institutions](/api-reference/institutions) | `country_code`, `type`, `is_global_south`, `continent`, `ror`, `has_ror` |
| [Topics](/api-reference/topics) | `domain.id`, `field.id`, `subfield.id`, `works_count` |
| [Keywords](/api-reference/keywords) | `works_count`, `cited_by_count` |
| [Publishers](/api-reference/publishers) | `country_codes`, `hierarchy_level`, `ror`, `parent_publisher` |
| [Funders](/api-reference/funders) | `country_code`, `is_global_south`, `continent`, `ror`, `awards_count` |

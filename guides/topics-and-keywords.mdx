description: Understanding topic classification in OpenAlex
---

OpenAlex assigns research topics and keywords to works using machine learning. This enables filtering and grouping by subject area.

## Topics

Topics are research areas organized in a 4-level hierarchy. OpenAlex has ~4,500 topics.

### How topics are assigned

Topics are assigned using a model that considers a work's title, abstract, source (journal) name, and citations. The method was developed in collaboration with [CWTS at Leiden University](https://www.cwts.nl/), extending their [Open Leiden rankings approach](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications):

1. **Cluster the citation network** for works with incoming and outgoing citations, producing meaningful clusters that correspond to research communities
2. **Label the clusters** using an LLM to generate topic names and descriptions
3. **Train a deep-learning model** that assigns topics using titles, abstracts, citations, and journal name — this model handles missing data, so it can classify new works without incoming citations
4. **Map topics** to subfields, fields, and domains based on Scopus's [ASJC categories](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/12007/supporthub/scopus/)

The highest-scoring topic becomes the work's `primary_topic`. Additional high-scoring topics appear in the `topics` array.

Most works are assigned topics. Some works don't have enough data (no title, abstract, or citations) and are excluded from classification.

For full details, see the methods paper: [OpenAlex: End-to-End Process for Topic Classification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDopkhuGieQ4F8gGNj7sEc8WSE8mvLZS/edit). Code and model: [openalex-topic-classification](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-topic-classification) on GitHub.

```bash
# List all topics

# Get a specific topic
https://api.openalex.org/topics/T10560
```

### Topic hierarchy

| Level | Name | Count | Example |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Domain | 4 | Life Sciences |
| 2 | Field | 26 | Medicine |
| 3 | Subfield | 254 | Endocrinology |
| 4 | Topic | ~4,500 | Diabetes Management |

```bash
# Get all domains

### Key properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `id` | OpenAlex ID (e.g., `T10560`) |
| `display_name` | Topic name |
| `description` | Brief description |
| `domain` | Parent domain |
| `field` | Parent field |
| `subfield` | Parent subfield |
| `works_count` | Number of tagged works |
| `siblings` | Related topics |

For a comprehensive field listing, see the [Get a single topic](/api-reference/topics/get-a-single-topic) response specification.

## Keywords

Keywords are short phrases derived from topics. Each topic has 10 associated keywords. To assign keywords to a work:

1. Take the topics assigned to the work (up to 3)
2. Pull the keywords for those topics (up to 30 candidates)
3. Score each keyword's similarity to the work's title and abstract using embeddings (BGE M3-Embedding model)
4. Keep the top 5 keywords above a similarity threshold

There are over 26,000 keywords. Source code: [openalex-keywords](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-keywords/tree/main/v2) on GitHub.

```bash
# List all keywords
https://api.openalex.org/keywords

# Get a specific keyword
https://api.openalex.org/keywords/type-1-diabetes
```

### Key properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `id` | OpenAlex ID |
| `display_name` | Keyword phrase |
| `works_count` | Number of tagged works |
| `cited_by_count` | Total citations |

For a comprehensive field listing, see the [Get a single keyword](/api-reference/keywords/get-a-single-keyword) response specification.

## SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)

Works are also tagged with UN Sustainable Development Goals when relevant.

```bash
# List all SDGs
https://api.openalex.org/sdgs

# Get works tagged with SDG 3 (Good Health)
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=sustainable_development_goals.id:3
```

| SDG | Name |
|-----|------|
| 1 | No Poverty |
| 2 | Zero Hunger |
| 3 | Good Health and Well-being |
| 4 | Quality Education |
| 5 | Gender Equality |
| 6 | Clean Water and Sanitation |
| 7 | Affordable and Clean Energy |
| 8 | Decent Work and Economic Growth |
| 9 | Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure |
| 10 | Reduced Inequalities |
| 11 | Sustainable Cities and Communities |
| 12 | Responsible Consumption and Production |
| 13 | Climate Action |
| 14 | Life Below Water |
| 15 | Life on Land |
| 16 | Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions |
| 17 | Partnerships for the Goals |

## Filtering works by subject

```bash
# Works in a specific topic
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=topics.id:T10560

# Works in a specific domain
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=topics.domain.id:1

# Works with a specific keyword
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=keywords.id:machine-learning

# Works tagged with SDG 13 (Climate Action)
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=sustainable_development_goals.id:13
```

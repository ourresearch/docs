description: Legacy taxonomy replaced by Topics

<Warning>
**Deprecated.** Concepts are OpenAlex's legacy subject classification system. Use [Topics](/guides/topics-and-keywords) instead for new projects. The Concepts API remains available for backward compatibility.
</Warning>

## What are Concepts?

Concepts were a hierarchical taxonomy of research areas, similar to Topics but based on the deprecated Microsoft Academic Graph classification. OpenAlex had ~65,000 concepts organized in 6 levels.

## Migration to Topics

Topics replaced Concepts in 2023. Key differences:

| Feature | Concepts | Topics |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Count | ~65,000 | ~4,500 |
| Hierarchy | 6 levels | 4 levels |
| Source | Microsoft Academic Graph | OpenAlex native |
| Status | Deprecated | Active |

## Using Concepts (if needed)

```bash
# List all concepts
https://api.openalex.org/concepts

# Get a specific concept
https://api.openalex.org/concepts/C71924100

# Works tagged with a concept
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=concepts.id:C71924100
```

### Key properties

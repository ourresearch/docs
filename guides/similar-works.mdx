title: "Discover similar works"
description: "Find semantically related works using AI-powered vector search"
---

OpenAlex's standard [search](/guides/searching) uses keyword matching—it finds works containing the words you type. But sometimes you want to find works that are *about* the same thing, even if they use different terminology.

That's what `search.semantic` does. It uses AI embeddings to find semantically similar works based on meaning, not just keywords. Search for "machine learning applications in drug discovery" and you'll find relevant papers even if they say "AI-driven pharmaceutical research" or "computational approaches to medicine."

<Warning>
Semantic search requires an API key and costs **100 credits per query**. See [rate limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) for details.
</Warning>

## How it works

When you submit a query:

1. Your text is converted into a 1024-dimensional vector using an embedding model
2. We search our index of ~217 million work embeddings for the most similar vectors
3. Results are returned ranked by similarity score

The embedding model ([GTE-Large](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-large)) captures semantic meaning, so conceptually related works cluster together even when they use different words.

## Basic usage

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?search.semantic=machine%20learning%20for%20drug%20discovery&api_key=YOUR_KEY"
```

Semantic search uses the standard `/works` endpoint with all the same parameters—`filter`, `sort`, `per_page`, `select`, etc.

### With filters

```bash
https://api.openalex.org/works?search.semantic=climate%20change%20adaptation&filter=publication_year:>2020,is_oa:true&per_page=50&api_key=YOUR_KEY
```

## Example: Literature review

Say you're starting a literature review on CRISPR applications in agriculture. Keyword search might miss papers that use terms like "genome editing" or "crop improvement" without mentioning "CRISPR" explicitly.

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.openalex.org/works",
    params={
        "search.semantic": "CRISPR gene editing applications in agriculture and crop improvement",
        "filter": "publication_year:>2020,is_oa:true",
        "per_page": 100,
        "api_key": "YOUR_KEY"
    }
)

for work in response.json()["results"][:10]:
    print(f"{work['title'][:80]}")
```

## Limitations

<Info>
**English-focused**: The embedding model is optimized for English text. Non-English works are indexed but similarity matching will be less accurate.
</Info>

<Info>
**Abstracts required**: Only works with abstracts are indexed (~217 million works). Works without abstracts won't appear in results.
</Info>

<Info>
**No datasets**: Dataset entities are not currently included in the vector index.

## Semantic search vs keyword search

| Use semantic search (`?search.semantic=`) when... | Use keyword search (`?search=`) when... |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| You want conceptually related works | You need exact term matches |
| You're exploring a new research area | You know the specific terminology |
| Your query is a sentence or paragraph | Your query is a few keywords |
| You want to find works using different terminology | You want to filter by many metadata fields |

title: Resolve IDs
description: Look up entity IDs by name before filtering
---

<Warning>
**Don't filter by names directly.** Entity names are ambiguous—"MIT" could match multiple institutions, "Smith" matches thousands of authors. Always resolve names to IDs first.
</Warning>

When you want to find works by a specific author, institution, journal, or topic, use the **two-step pattern**:

1. **Search** for the entity to get its OpenAlex ID
2. **Filter** works using that ID

This avoids hallucinated filters and ensures you get the right entity.

## The Two-Step Pattern

### Step 1: Search for the Entity

Use the search endpoint for the entity type:

```bash
# Find an author
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors?search=Albert+Einstein"

# Find an institution
curl "https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=MIT"

# Find a journal
curl "https://api.openalex.org/sources?search=Nature"

# Find a topic
curl "https://api.openalex.org/topics?search=machine+learning"
```

The response includes IDs you can use:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "https://openalex.org/A5012345678",
      "display_name": "Albert Einstein",
      "works_count": 272
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Filter Works by ID

Use the ID to filter works:

```bash
# Works by this author
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.author.id:A5012345678"

# Works from this institution
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:I136199984"

# Works in this journal
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=primary_location.source.id:S137773608"

# Works on this topic
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=topics.id:T12345"
```

## Common Lookups

### Find Works by Author Name

```bash
# Step 1: Search for the author
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors?search=Heather+Piwowar"
# Response: id = "https://openalex.org/A5023888391"

# Step 2: Get their works
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.author.id:A5023888391"
```

### Find Works by Institution Name

```bash
# Step 1: Search for the institution
curl "https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=Stanford+University"
# Response: id = "https://openalex.org/I97018004"

# Step 2: Get works from that institution
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:I97018004"
```

### Find Works by Journal Name

```bash
# Step 1: Search for the journal (source)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/sources?search=Nature"
# Response: id = "https://openalex.org/S137773608"

# Step 2: Get works published there
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=primary_location.source.id:S137773608"
```

### Find Works by Topic

```bash
# Step 1: Search for the topic
curl "https://api.openalex.org/topics?search=CRISPR"
# Response: id = "https://openalex.org/T10234"

# Step 2: Get works on that topic
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=topics.id:T10234"
```

## When You Have External IDs

If you already have an external identifier (DOI, ORCID, ROR, ISSN), you can skip the search step and use the ID directly:

```bash
# By ORCID (author)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.author.id:https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1613-5981"

# By ROR (institution)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:https://ror.org/042nb2s44"

# By ISSN (source/journal)
curl "https://api.openalex.org/sources/issn:0028-0836"
# Then use the returned OpenAlex ID
```

## Decision Guide

| Input Type | What to Do |
|------------|------------|
| Name (ambiguous) | Search first, then filter by ID |
| ORCID | Use directly: `authorships.author.id:https://orcid.org/...` |
| ROR | Use directly: `authorships.institutions.id:https://ror.org/...` |
| DOI | Get work directly: `/works/https://doi.org/...` |
| ISSN | Get source by ISSN, then filter by source ID |
| OpenAlex ID | Use directly: `authorships.author.id:A123456` |

## Handling Ambiguous Results

When searching returns multiple matches, you need to pick the right one. Here are strategies:

### Use Additional Filters

Narrow down the search:

```bash
# Author named "Smith" affiliated with MIT
curl "https://api.openalex.org/authors?search=Smith&filter=last_known_institution.id:I63966007"
```

### Check Display Name and Metadata

Look at `display_name`, `works_count`, `cited_by_count`, and institutional affiliations to identify the right entity.

### Use Autocomplete for Interactive UIs

The autocomplete endpoint is fast and returns ranked results:

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/autocomplete/authors?q=einst"
```

## Filter Field Reference

| To find works by... | Filter field |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Author | `authorships.author.id` |
| Author's institution | `authorships.institutions.id` |
| Primary source (journal) | `primary_location.source.id` |
| Any source | `locations.source.id` |
| Topic | `topics.id` or `primary_topic.id` |
| Publisher | `primary_location.source.host_organization` |
| Funder | `funders.id` |

## Example: Complete Workflow

Find highly-cited papers about machine learning from MIT in the last 3 years:

```bash
# 1. Get MIT's ID
curl "https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=MIT"
# Result: I63966007

# 2. Get machine learning topic ID
curl "https://api.openalex.org/topics?search=machine+learning"
# Result: T154945302

# 3. Filter works with all criteria
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=authorships.institutions.id:I63966007,topics.id:T154945302,publication_year:>2022&sort=cited_by_count:desc"
```

<Warning>
Concepts are **deprecated** and have been replaced by [Topics](/api-reference/topics). The concepts endpoints remain functional but will not receive updates.
</Warning>

Concepts were a hierarchical taxonomy of research areas derived from Wikidata. They have been replaced by the Topics system, which provides more accurate and comprehensive classification.

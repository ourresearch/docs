Languages represent the languages in which scholarly works are written. OpenAlex automatically detects the language of each work.

## Filter, sort, and group_by fields

The API supports filtering, sorting, and grouping on languages fields. See [Filtering](/guides/filtering), [Sorting](/guides/sort), and [Grouping](/guides/grouping) for syntax.

Fields marked **(deprecated)** are `.search` filters — use the [`search` parameter](/guides/searching) instead.

Continents represent the major geographic regions of the world. They are used for filtering works by geographic region and for understanding the global distribution of research.

## Filter, sort, and group_by fields

The API supports filtering, sorting, and grouping on continents fields. See [Filtering](/guides/filtering), [Sorting](/guides/sort), and [Grouping](/guides/grouping) for syntax.

Fields marked **(deprecated)** are `.search` filters — use the [`search` parameter](/guides/searching) instead.

Domains are the highest level of the OpenAlex topic hierarchy. There are only 4 domains, each containing multiple fields: Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Health Sciences.

The topic hierarchy is: **Domain** → Field → Subfield → Topic

## Filter, sort, and group_by fields

The API supports filtering, sorting, and grouping on domains fields. See [Filtering](/guides/filtering), [Sorting](/guides/sort), and [Grouping](/guides/grouping) for syntax.

Fields marked **(deprecated)** are `.search` filters — use the [`search` parameter](/guides/searching) instead.

The OpenAlex API uses a credit-based rate limiting system. Different endpoint types consume different amounts of credits per request.

<Warning>
**API key required starting February 13, 2026.** API keys are free—[get yours here](https://openalex.org/settings/api). See the [announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/rI1GIAySpVQ) for details.
</Warning>

## Getting an API Key

API keys are free. Here's how to get one:

1. Create a free account at [openalex.org](https://openalex.org)
2. Go to [openalex.org/settings/api](https://openalex.org/settings/api) to get your key
3. Add `api_key=YOUR_KEY` to your API calls

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
```

Without an API key, you're limited to 100 credits per day—enough for quick tests, but not for real work.

## Rate Limits

| Plan | Daily Credits | Requests/Second |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| No API key | 100 | 100 |
| Free API key | 10,000 | 100 |
| [Paid plan](https://openalex.org/pricing) | Higher limits | 100 |

All plans can purchase additional credits at **$1 per 10,000 credits**.

Academic researchers can often get increased limits for free—contact [support@openalex.org](mailto:support@openalex.org).

## Credit Costs by Endpoint

| Tier | Example | Credits |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Singleton** — Retrieve by ID or DOI | `/works/W123` or `/works/doi:10.1234/foo` | FREE |
| **List / Filter** — Query and filter entities | `/works?filter=institution.id:I123` | 1 |
| **Search** — Full-text and semantic search | `/works?search=climate+change` | 10 |
| **Content Download** — Cached PDF via content API | `content.openalex.org/works/{id}.pdf` | 100 |
| **Text/Aboutness** *(deprecated)* | `/text/topics` | 1,000 |

### What you can do for free every day

With a free API key (10,000 credits/day), you can make per day:
- **Unlimited** singleton requests (they're free)
- **10,000** list/filter requests, or
- **1,000** search requests, or
- **100** content downloads, or
- Any combination that adds up to 10,000 credits

### Common Activity Costs

| Activity | Calls | Credits | Cost |
|----------|-------|---------|------|
| Download 1,000 PDFs | 1,000 content downloads | 100,000 | $10 |
| Retrieve 1M Works about "Climate Change AND Kelp" | ~5,000 paginated search calls | 50,000 | $5 |
| Retrieve 1M Works by DOI from a list | 1M singleton calls | 0 | Free |
| Filter all Works from an Institution (1M results) | ~5,000 list calls | 5,000 | $0.50 |
| Daily research (20 searches, 200 filters, 50 lookups) | 270 calls | 2,200 | Free |

### High-cost endpoints

Some endpoints consume significantly more credits:

| Endpoint | Credits | Daily limit (free) | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| [Search](/guides/searching) | 10 | ~1,000 requests | `?search=` query parameter |
| [Content downloads](/download/full-text-pdfs) | 100 | ~100 files | PDF or TEI XML |
| Aboutness (`/text`) | 1,000 | ~10 requests | Deprecated |

<Warning>
**Planning bulk content downloads?** Downloading all 60M available PDFs would require 6 billion credits. [Contact us](mailto:steve@ourresearch.org) about enterprise credit packs for large-scale projects.
</Warning>

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes headers showing your current status:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Your total daily credit limit |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Credits remaining for today |
| `X-RateLimit-Credits-Used` | Credits consumed by this request |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Seconds until your credits reset (midnight UTC) |

## Check Your Status

Check your current rate limit status using the `/rate-limit` endpoint:

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/rate-limit?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "api_key": "abc...xyz",
  "rate_limit": {
    "credits_limit": 10000,
    "credits_used": 1234,
    "credits_remaining": 8766,
    "resets_at": "2026-01-02T00:00:00.000Z",
    "resets_in_seconds": 43200,
    "credit_costs": {
      "singleton": 0,
      "list": 1,
      "search": 10,
      "content": 100,
      "text": 1000
    }
  }
}
```

## Exceeding Limits

If you exceed your daily credits or make more than 100 requests per second, you'll get `429 Too Many Requests` errors.

**Best practices:**
- Use `per_page=100` to reduce the number of requests needed
- Batch ID lookups using the [OR syntax](/guides/filtering#or-operator) (up to 100 values per filter)
- Use `select=` to [limit returned fields](/guides/selecting-fields) for faster responses
- Implement [exponential backoff](/api-reference/errors#retry-logic) when you hit rate limits

## Query Limits

Beyond rate limits, individual queries have these constraints:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| OR values per filter | 100 |
| `per_page` maximum | 100 |
| `sample` maximum | 10,000 |
| Basic paging limit | 10,000 results |

To retrieve more than 10,000 results, use [cursor paging](/guides/page-through-results#cursor-paging).

## Usage Tips

### Browser Testing

The API uses simple GET requests, so you can test any request in your browser. Install a JSON formatter extension for a better experience:
- [JSONVue (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonvue/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc)
- [JSONView (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jsonview)

### Efficient Bulk Extraction

```python
# Use maximum page size
requests.get("https://api.openalex.org/works?per_page=100&api_key=YOUR_KEY")

# Batch DOI lookups (up to 100 at once)
dois = "10.1234/a|10.1234/b|10.1234/c"
requests.get(f"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=doi:{dois}&api_key=YOUR_KEY")
```

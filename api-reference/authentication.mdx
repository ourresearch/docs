The OpenAlex API uses usage-based pricing on a freemium model. Different types of usage have different costs per request. A free API key is required.

## Getting an API Key

API keys are free. Here's how to get one:

1. Create a free account at [openalex.org](https://openalex.org)
2. Go to [openalex.org/settings/api](https://openalex.org/settings/api) to get your key
3. Add `api_key=YOUR_KEY` to your API calls

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/works?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
```

Without an API key, you're limited to $0.01/day of usage—enough for quick tests, but not for real work.

## Pricing by Endpoint

<Tip>
Use `per_page=100` to load many results per query--it makes your query budget go much further.
</Tip>

| Operation | Description | **Cost per 1,000 calls** |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| [Get singleton](/guides/get) | Retrieve a single entity by ID or DOI | **Free** |
| [List+Filter](/guides/filtering) | Query and filter entities | **$0.10** |
| [Search](/guides/searching) | Full-text keyword search | **$1** |
| [Semantic search](/guides/searching) | AI-powered semantic search | **$1** |
| [Content download](/download/full-text-pdfs) | Cached PDF via content API | **$10** |
| [Text/Aboutness](/guides/deprecations) *(deprecated)* | Topic classification | **$10** |

## Common Activity Costs

| Activity | Endpoint | Calls | Results | Cost |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|------|
| Search "climate change AND kelp" | Search | 103 | 10,205 | $0.10 |
| All works from Harvard | List+Filter | 8,707 | 870,627 | $0.87 |
| Retrieve works by DOI from a list | Singleton | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | Free |
| Daily research (20 searches, 200 filters, 50 lookups) | Mixed | 270 | ~27,000 | $0.04 |
| Download 1,000 PDFs | Content | 1,000 | 1,000 PDFs | $10.00 |

## What You Can Do for Free Every Day

With a free API key ($1/day allowance), you can make per day:
- **Unlimited** singleton requests (they're free)
- **10,000** list+filter requests (1M results at 100/page)
- **1,000** search requests (100K results at 100/page)
- **100** content downloads
- Any mix totaling $1

## Usage Limits

| Plan | Daily Allowance | Requests/Second |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| No API key | $0.01 | 100 |
| Free API key | $1 | 100 |
| [Paid plan](https://openalex.org/pricing) | Higher limits | 100 |
| [Prepaid usage](https://openalex.org/pricing#prepaid-usage) | Based on balance | 100 |

Academic researchers can often get increased limits for free—contact [support@openalex.org](mailto:support@openalex.org).

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes headers showing your current status:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Your total daily limit |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Remaining for today |
| `X-RateLimit-Credits-Used` | Cost of this request |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Seconds until reset (midnight UTC) |

## Check Your Status

Check your current usage status using the `/rate-limit` endpoint:

```bash
curl "https://api.openalex.org/rate-limit?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "api_key": "abc...xyz",
  "rate_limit": {
    "daily_budget_usd": 1,
    "daily_used_usd": 0.05,
    "daily_remaining_usd": 0.95,
    "prepaid_balance_usd": 0,
    "prepaid_remaining_usd": 0,
    "prepaid_expires_at": null,
    "resets_at": "2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z",
    "resets_in_seconds": 43200,
    "endpoint_costs_usd": {
      "singleton": 0,
      "list": 0.0001,
      "search": 0.001,
      "semantic": 0.01,
      "content": 0.01,
      "text": 0.01
    }
  }
}
```

## Exceeding Limits

If you exceed your daily limit or make more than 100 requests per second, you'll get `429 Too Many Requests` errors.

**Best practices:**
- Use `per_page=100` to reduce the number of requests needed
- Batch ID lookups using the [OR syntax](/guides/filtering#or-operator) (up to 100 values per filter)
- Use `select=` to [limit returned fields](/guides/selecting-fields) for faster responses
- Implement [exponential backoff](/api-reference/errors#retry-logic) when you hit rate limits

## Query Limits

Beyond usage limits, individual queries have these constraints:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| OR values per filter | 100 |
| `per_page` maximum | 100 |
| `sample` maximum | 10,000 |
| Basic paging limit | 10,000 results |

To retrieve more than 10,000 results, use [cursor paging](/guides/page-through-results#cursor-paging).

## Usage Tips

### Browser Testing

The API uses simple GET requests, so you can test any request in your browser. Install a JSON formatter extension for a better experience:
- [JSONVue (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonvue/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc)
- [JSONView (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jsonview)

### Efficient Bulk Extraction

```python
# Use maximum page size
requests.get("https://api.openalex.org/works?per_page=100&api_key=YOUR_KEY")

# Batch DOI lookups (up to 100 at once)
dois = "10.1234/a|10.1234/b|10.1234/c"
requests.get(f"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=doi:{dois}&api_key=YOUR_KEY")
```

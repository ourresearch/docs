description: Get the OpenAlex snapshot files onto your local machine using the AWS CLI
---

The OpenAlex snapshot is hosted on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and is **free to download**. You don't need an AWS account.

<Info>
Many thanks to the [AWS Open Data program](https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/), which covers the data-transfer fees (about $70 per download) so users don't have to.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html). All commands in this guide use it. No account or credentials are needed — the `--no-sign-request` flag provides anonymous access.

You can also browse the snapshot in your browser: [openalex.s3.amazonaws.com/browse.html](https://openalex.s3.amazonaws.com/browse.html)

## Download the full snapshot

This copies everything in the `openalex` S3 bucket to a local folder. It takes about **330 GB** of disk space.

```bash
aws s3 sync "s3://openalex" "openalex-snapshot" --no-sign-request
```

<Warning>
If you're downloading into a folder that already has a previous snapshot, use the `--delete` flag to remove outdated files. Otherwise you'll get duplicate entities that have moved between partitions.

```bash
aws s3 sync "s3://openalex" "openalex-snapshot" --no-sign-request --delete
```
</Warning>

## Check the current size

The snapshot size changes over time. Check before downloading:

```bash
aws s3 ls --summarize --human-readable --no-sign-request --recursive "s3://openalex/"
```

## File structure

After downloading, you'll have a structure like this:

```
openalex-snapshot/
├── LICENSE.txt
├── RELEASE_NOTES.txt
└── data
    ├── authors
    │   ├── manifest
    │   └── updated_date=2024-01-15
    │       ├── 0000_part_00.gz
    │       └── 0001_part_00.gz

    ├── publishers
    │   └── ...
    ├── funders
    │   └── ...
    └── merged_ids
        └── ...
```

See [Snapshot data format](/download/snapshot-format) for details on the partition structure and how to keep your copy up to date.

## Download a single entity type

If you only need one entity type, specify the prefix:

```bash
aws s3 sync "s3://openalex/data/works" "openalex-snapshot/data/works" --no-sign-request
```

## Alternatives to local download

If you don't want to download files locally, some services can read directly from S3:

- **Amazon Redshift:** [Load from S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/tutorial-loading-data.html) using the manifest files
- **ETL tools** with S3 connectors (Xplenty, Airbyte, etc.)

For these approaches, the [snapshot data format](/download/snapshot-format) documentation should have enough detail to get started.

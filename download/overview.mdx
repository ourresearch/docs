## Download options

### OpenAlex Snapshot

The complete OpenAlex database as gzip-compressed JSON Lines files, updated monthly. Includes works, authors, sources, institutions, topics, publishers, funders, and more.

**Best for:** Full database replication, data warehousing, comprehensive analysis

**Size:** ~330 GB compressed, ~1.6 TB decompressed

[Learn more about the snapshot format](/download/snapshot-format)

### OpenAlex CLI

The official command-line tool for downloading filtered subsets of OpenAlex data.

```bash
pip install openalex-official
openalex download --api-key YOUR_KEY --filter "publication_year:2024" --output ./data
```

**Best for:** Downloading specific subsets without the full snapshot

[OpenAlex CLI documentation](/download/openalex-cli)

### Full-text PDFs

Download PDFs and TEI XML for about 60 million works. Requires an API key — content downloads cost $0.01 per file.

**Best for:** Text mining, content analysis, building corpora

## Decision tree

```
Do you need the complete database?
├── Yes → Download the snapshot
│         (/download/snapshot-format)
└── No
    ├── Do you need filtered metadata or content files?
    │   ├── Yes → Use the OpenAlex CLI
    │   │         (/download/openalex-cli)
    │   └── No → Use the REST API
    │             (/api-reference/introduction)
    └── Do you need bulk full-text PDFs?
        ├── Yes → See full-text PDF options
        │         (/download/full-text-pdfs)
        └── No → Use the REST API
```

## Getting started

1. **For the snapshot:** Follow the [download instructions](/download/download-to-machine) to get the data to your machine
2. **For the CLI:** Install with `pip install openalex-official` and run `openalex download --help`
3. **For PDFs:** See [full-text PDFs](/download/full-text-pdfs) for the three download options

<Warning>
Working with the full snapshot is challenging. The dataset is large (330 GB+ compressed) and complex. If you're unsure, start with the REST API — it can answer most questions with much less setup.
</Warning>

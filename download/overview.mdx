# Data Downloads

OpenAlex offers multiple ways to access data beyond the REST API. Choose the approach that best fits your use case.

## Download options

### OpenAlex Snapshot

The complete OpenAlex database as JSON Lines files, updated monthly. Each file contains one entity type (works, authors, sources, institutions, topics, publishers, funders).

**Best for:** Full database replication, data warehousing, comprehensive analysis

**Size:** ~500GB compressed

[Learn more about the snapshot format](/download/snapshot-format)

### OpenAlex CLI

A command-line tool for downloading filtered subsets of OpenAlex data.

```bash
pip install openalex-cli
openalex download --filter "publication_year:2024" --output ./data
```

**Best for:** Downloading specific subsets without the full snapshot

[OpenAlex CLI documentation](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-cli)

### Full-text PDFs

Download PDFs and TEI XML for works with available content. Requires an API key and consumes 100 credits per file.

**Best for:** Text mining, content analysis, building corpora

[Content download documentation](/guides/content-downloads)

## Decision tree

```
Do you need the complete database?
├── Yes → Download the snapshot
└── No → Do you need a filtered subset?
    ├── Yes → Use OpenAlex CLI
    └── No → Use the REST API
```

## Getting started

1. **For the snapshot:** Follow the [download instructions](/download/download-to-machine) to get the data to your machine
2. **For the CLI:** Install with `pip install openalex-cli` and run `openalex --help`
3. **For PDFs:** Use the [content download API](/guides/content-downloads) with your API key

<Warning>
Working with the full snapshot is challenging. The dataset is large (500GB+ compressed) and complex. If you're unsure, start with the REST API—it can answer most questions with much less setup.
</Warning>

## Loading data

Once downloaded, you can load OpenAlex data into:

- **Data warehouses** (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks) — Load JSON directly, query with native JSON functions
- **Relational databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL) — Flatten to normalized schema
- **Search engines** (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch) — Index for full-text search

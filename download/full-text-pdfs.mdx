description: Download full-text PDFs and TEI XML for millions of works
---

OpenAlex has cached full-text content for about 60 million works:

| Format | Files | Size |
|--------|-------|------|
| PDF | ~60M | ~250 TB |
| TEI XML | ~43M | ~20 TB |

TEI XML files are machine-readable structured text parsed by [Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid).

## Download options

### Option 1: API (up to ~10K files)

Download files one at a time from the content API. Each download costs **100 credits**.

```
https://content.openalex.org/works/{work_id}.pdf?api_key=YOUR_KEY
```

| Extension | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| `.pdf` | PDF (default) |
| `.grobid-xml` | TEI XML |

<CodeGroup>
```bash PDF
curl "https://content.openalex.org/works/W2741809807.pdf?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
```

```bash TEI XML
curl "https://content.openalex.org/works/W2741809807.grobid-xml?api_key=YOUR_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Finding downloadable works:**

Use the `has_content` filter to find works with available content:

```bash
# Works with PDFs from 2024
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_content.pdf:true,publication_year:2024

# CC-BY works with PDFs
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_content.pdf:true,best_oa_location.license:cc-by
```

You can also check the `content_url` field on any work object to see if content is available.

With a free API key (100K credits/day), you can download about 1,000 files per day. Good for research projects, building small corpora, or sampling.

### Option 2: OpenAlex CLI (up to a few million files)

For larger downloads, use the [OpenAlex CLI](/download/openalex-cli). It handles parallel downloads, retries, checkpointing, and resume automatically.

```bash
pip install openalex-official
```

**Download PDFs for a specific topic:**

```bash
openalex download \
  --api-key YOUR_KEY \
  --output ./climate-pdfs \
  --filter "topics.id:T10325,has_content.pdf:true" \
  --content pdf
```

**Download works with Creative Commons licenses:**

```bash
openalex download \
  --api-key YOUR_KEY \
  --output ./cc-pdfs \
  --filter "best_oa_location.license:cc-by,has_content.pdf:true" \
  --content pdf
```

**Download metadata + PDFs + TEI XML:**

```bash
openalex download \
  --api-key YOUR_KEY \
  --output ./my-corpus \
  --filter "topics.id:T10325,has_content.pdf:true" \
  --content pdf,xml
```

Standard credit rates apply (100 credits per content file; metadata is free). At full speed, you can download a few million files in a few days.

### Option 3: Complete archive sync

For the complete archive (all 60M files), we provide direct access to the storage bucket via time-limited credentials. Files are stored on [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), which is fully S3-compatible.

**One-time download:** 30-day R2 read access to sync the complete archive.

**Ongoing sync:** Persistent R2 read access is included with the enterprise subscription.

See the [pricing page](https://openalex.org/pricing) for details, or [contact us](mailto:steve@ourresearch.org) to get started.

**How it works:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get credentials">
    We generate R2 API credentials with read-only access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync with AWS CLI">
    ```bash
    aws s3 sync s3://openalex-pdfs ./pdfs \
      --endpoint-url https://a452eddbbe06eb7d02f4879cee70d29c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stay current">
    For ongoing sync, run periodically to get new files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

At typical network speeds, expect **1–2 weeks** to download the full archive.

## File naming

Files are named by UUID, not work ID:

```
openalex-pdfs/
├── 3a07228e-de2a-4c37-955d-b1411a498328.pdf
├── 7b12f4a1-8c9d-4e5f-a2b3-c4d5e6f7a8b9.pdf
└── ...

openalex-grobid-xml/
├── 3a07228e-de2a-4c37-955d-b1411a498328.xml.gz
├── 7b12f4a1-8c9d-4e5f-a2b3-c4d5e6f7a8b9.xml.gz
└── ...
```

To map work IDs to file UUIDs, use the [snapshot data](/download/snapshot-format). The `locations` array in each work contains `pdf_url` fields that include the UUID.

## Licensing

The PDFs retain their original copyright. OpenAlex does not grant any additional rights to the content.

To check the license for a specific work, use the `best_oa_location.license` field in the API:

```
https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=has_content.pdf:true,best_oa_location.license:cc-by
```

This returns works that have downloadable PDFs and are licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
